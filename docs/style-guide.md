# Style Guide

This document outlines the design system, typography, color palette, and component styling for the personal branding website, based on the provided reference image. The aesthetic is minimalist, modern, and typographical with brutalist influences.

## 1. Color Palette

The color scheme is strictly monochrome, creating a high-contrast and impactful visual experience.

| Role | Color | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Background** | White | `#FFFFFF` | Main background for light sections. |
| **Secondary Background** | Black | `#000000` | Main background for dark sections. |
| **Primary Text** | Black | `#000000` | Text on white backgrounds. |
| **Secondary Text** | White | `#FFFFFF` | Text on black backgrounds. |
| **Accent / Muted Text**| Gray | `#808080` | De-emphasized text, secondary information. |

## 2. Typography

The typography is a key element of the design. It uses a combination of a bold, impactful display font for headings and a clean monospaced font for body text and UI elements.

### Font Families

*   **Primary Font (Headings):** A bold, extended, or wide sans-serif font. This font should be used for all major headings (H1, H2) to create a strong visual impact.
    *   **Suggested Fonts:** `Anton`, `Oswald`, `Bebas Neue`.
*   **Secondary Font (Body & UI):** A clean, legible monospaced font. This font gives the site a technical and structured feel, suitable for descriptions, navigation, and links.
    *   **Suggested Fonts:** `Roboto Mono`, `Space Mono`, `Source Code Pro`.

### Typographic Scale

| Element | Font Family | Font Weight | Size (suggestion) | Letter Spacing | Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H1 (Hero)** | Primary | Bold | 6rem - 10rem | Normal | Uppercase |
| **H2 (Section Title)** | Primary | Bold | 4rem - 6rem | Normal | Uppercase |
| **H3 (Subsection Title)** | Secondary | Bold | 1.5rem | Wide | Uppercase |
| **Body / Paragraph** | Secondary | Regular | 1rem | Normal | Uppercase / Sentence |
| **Navigation / Links** | Secondary | Regular | 0.875rem | Normal | Uppercase |

## 3. Layout and Spacing

*   **Grid System:** The layout should be based on a structured grid (e.g., a 12-column grid) to ensure alignment and consistency.
*   **Whitespace:** Use generous whitespace around elements to create a clean, uncluttered, and premium feel. Spacing should be consistent, using a base unit (e.g., 8px) for margins and paddings (`8px`, `16px`, `24px`, `32px`, etc.).
*   **Dividers:** Use thin, 1px solid lines in the primary text color to separate sections or UI elements (e.g., in the header or between grid items).

## 4. UI Components

### Buttons & Links

*   **Primary CTA:** Simple text links using the secondary (monospaced) font, often accompanied by a right-facing arrow (`>`). Example: `CONTACT ME >`
*   **Navigation Links:** Text enclosed in square brackets. Example: `[ WORKS ]`
*   **Hover State:** Links should have a subtle hover effect, such as a slight change in opacity or a minimal underline, without changing color.

### Forms

*   **Input Fields:** Minimalist design with a simple bottom border. No background color or heavy borders.
*   **Labels:** Use the secondary (monospaced) font, often in all caps, placed above the input field.

## 5. Imagery

*   **Style:** All photography should be black and white.
*   **Content:** Images should be professional, high-quality, and align with the minimalist aesthetic. They can be portraits, abstract shots, or project-related visuals.
